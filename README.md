1. Even though i was able do this with a lot of research and help from chatGPT. 
2. There is a lot thing i really dont understand. Do i have to know everything in this assignment like the back of my hand?
3. I have never tried JS backend before, makes me more confused as of now, i only learnt with python (Django and Flask).
4. Does this server appear in all JS Backend?
5. Unlike PHP which i guess can handle MYsqli stuff, can it also handle such?
